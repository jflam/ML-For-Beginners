# Search for a bot

## Instructions

Bots are everywhere. Your assignment: find one and adopt it! You can find them on web sites, in banking applications, and on the phone, for example when you call financial services companies for advice or account information. Analyze the bot and see if you can confuse it. If you can confuse the bot, why do you think that happened? Write a short paper about your experience.
