# Make a Bot talk back

## Instructions

In the past few lessons, you programmed a basic bot with whom to chat. This bot gives random answers until you say 'bye'. Can you make the answers a little less random, and trigger answers if you say specific things, like 'why' or 'how'? Think a bit how machine learning might make this type of work less manual as you extend your bot. You can use NLTK or TextBlob libraries to make your tasks easier.
