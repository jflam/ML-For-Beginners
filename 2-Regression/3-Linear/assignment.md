# Create a Regression Model

## Instructions

In this lesson you were shown how to build a model using both Linear and Polynomial Regression. Using this knowledge, find a dataset or use one of Scikit-learn's built-in sets to build a fresh model. Explain in your notebook why you chose the technique you did, and demonstrate your model's accuracy. If it is not accurate, explain why.
