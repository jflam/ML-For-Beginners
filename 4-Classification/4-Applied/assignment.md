# Build a recommender

## Instructions

Given your exercises in this lesson, you now know how to build JavaScript-based web app using Onnx Runtime and a converted Onnx model. Experiment with building a new recommender using data from these lessons or sourced elsewhere (give credit, please). You might create a pet recommender given various personality attributes, or a music genre recommender based on a person's mood. Be creative!
