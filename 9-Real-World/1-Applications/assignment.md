# A ML Scavenger Hunt

## Instructions

In this lesson, you learned about many real-life use cases that were solved using classical ML. While the use of deep learning, new techniques and tools in AI, and leveraging neural networks has helped speed up the production of tools to help in these sectors, classic ML using the techniques in this curriculum still hold great value.

In this assignment, imagine that you are participating in a hackathon. Use what you learned in the curriculum to propose a solution using classic ML to solve a problem in one of the sectors discussed in this lesson. Create a presentation where you discuss how you will implement your idea. Bonus points if you can gather sample data and build a ML model to support your concept!
